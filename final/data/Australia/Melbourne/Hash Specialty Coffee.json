I work with a wide selection of natural media and found pigments; by experimenting with the nuances of their behaviour I convert them into sociocritical illustrative works. My inspiration comes from my life as a traveller, and the many characters, cultures, and lifestyles I encounter therein. I had exhibited in Dresden in 2009, in Berlin in 2012, in Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane 2015. In 2016 I started to exhibit my art in Melbourne again and went than to Europa, where I displayed my art in London and Amsterdam. I’m currently living and working as a street artist in Germany where I illustrate with coffee, tea and ink.", "disclaimer": "Restaurants are solely responsible for the service; availability and quality of the events including all or any cancellations/ modifications/ complaints.", "photos": [{"photo": {"md5sum": "896bc6646ef0a5732bb86e0b43cc0e18", "uuid": 1491877714629151, "thumb_url": "https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/zomato_events/photos/e18/896bc6646ef0a5732bb86e0b43cc0e18_1491877723.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A", "photo_id": 187745, "type": "NORMAL", "url": "https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/zomato_events/photos/e18/896bc6646ef0a5732bb86e0b43cc0e18_1491877723.jpg", "order": 0}}], "is_end_time_set": 1, "event_category": 0, "date_added": "2017-04-11 07:58:43", "book_link": "", "event_id": 119466, "start_time": "01:00:00", "share_url": "http://www.zoma.to/r/17849632", "end_time": "19:00:00", "restaurants": []}}]}}
